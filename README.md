# Triple Bond custom NDS-Ironmon-Tracker

# Info

This fork was made to tweak the NDS Ironmon Tracker in order to make it more suitable for the Triple Bond Challenge. **All credit goes to Brian0255 (OnlySpaghettiCode) and contributors for all their work.**

HUGE THANKS to OnlySpaghettiCode, UTDZac, and Mixone for helping make this compatible with the challenge.

If you're looking for the ACTUAL NDS Ironmon Tracker go here: [release page](https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker/releases) for changelogs and downloads.

## Controls
**Select Button**: While in/out of battle you can cycle between your party members.

**L Button**: Toggle EVs window to see the current EVs on your Pokemon.

**Start Button**: Only while in battle you can cycle between the enemy mon and your active mon.


## Installation

**Installation Video Tutorial: [https://youtu.be/JEbL4Elem0o](https://youtu.be/JEbL4Elem0o)**

1. If you don't have BizHawk, [download the emulator](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/releases/tag/2.10)
   - **IMPORTANT**: **Run BizHawk once and close it.**  This creates a config file in BizHawk's folder that ensures the tracker will work correctly. If you don't do 			this, errors may occur.
2. Download this tracker from the [releases](https://github.com/arexbold/TripleBondTracker/releases/) section.
3. Unzip the tracker's files to a location of your choosing. One good location is the `Lua` folder where you installed BizHawk. Make sure the "ironmon_tracker" folder is in the same directory as "Ironmon_Tracker.lua".
4. Load your ROM into [BizHawk](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory).
5. Open the Lua Console (Tools -> Lua Console). Click on the folder icon and open `Triplebond-Tracker.lua` in the location you extracted it to.
   - If you installed the tracker in Bizhawk's `Lua` folder, this location is shown by default and you should see the `Triplebond-Tracker.lua` file right away.
6. Setup the New Run Settings in the Tracker to set your ROM to randomize, Randomizer JAR, and Settings file.
7. Once they're set, press and hold A + B + Start + Select to do your first run. Use the same combo to start a new run.

### Compatibility

Will only work with a Triple Bond patch on Pokemon HeartGold.


# Other problems

I've modified this so any bugs will most likely be my fault. There is a FAQ section on the original page that might help with more common errors: [https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker#FAQ](https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker#FAQ) **OTHERWISE PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER THEM FOR HELP SINCE I'VE MODIFIED THIS.** You're better off using the original tracker if you're not playing the Triple Bond Challenge.
